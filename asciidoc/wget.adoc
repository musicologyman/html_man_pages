=== Name

Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.

=== Synopsis

wget [_option_]... [ _[.small]#URL#_ ]...

=== Description

[.small]#GNU# Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of
files from the Web. It supports [.small]#HTTP# , [.small]#HTTPS# , and
[.small]#FTP# protocols, as well as retrieval through [.small]#HTTP#
proxies.

Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

Wget can follow links in [.small]#HTML# , [.small]#XHTML# , and
[.small]#CSS# pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully
recreating the directory structure of the original site. This is
sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading." While doing that, Wget
respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (_/robots.txt_). Wget can be
instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the
local files, for offline viewing.

Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
retrying until the whole file has been retrieved. If the server supports
regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from
where it left off.

=== Options

*Option Syntax*

Since Wget uses [.small]#GNU# getopt to process command-line arguments,
every option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are
more convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments. Thus you may write:::
[source,code]
----
wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
----
  +
  The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
  may be omitted. Instead of *-o log* you can write *-olog*.
  +
  You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
  like:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -drc <URL>
----
  +
  This is completely equivalent to:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -d -r -c <URL>
----
  +
  Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
  terminate them with *--*. So the following will try to download
  [.small]#URL# *-x*, reporting failure to _log_:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -o log -- -x
----
  +
  The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
  convention that specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be
  useful to clear the _.wgetrc_ settings. For instance, if your
  _.wgetrc_ sets "exclude_directories" to _/cgi-bin_, the following
  example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude _/~nobody_ and
  _/~somebody_. You can also clear the lists in _.wgetrc_.
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -X " -X /~nobody,/~somebody
----
  +
  Most options that do not accept arguments are _boolean_ options, so
  named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no ("boolean")
  variable. For example, *--follow-ftp* tells Wget to follow
  [.small]#FTP# links from [.small]#HTML# files and, on the other hand,
  *--no-glob* tells it not to perform file globbing on [.small]#FTP#
  URLs. A boolean option is either _affirmative_ or _negative_
  (beginning with *--no*). All such options share several properties.
  +
  Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
  the opposite of what the option accomplishes. For example, the
  documented existence of *--follow-ftp* assumes that the default is to
  _not_ follow [.small]#FTP# links from [.small]#HTML# pages.
  +
  Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the *--no-* to the
  option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the *--no-*
  prefix. This might seem superfluous---if the default for an
  affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to
  explicitly turn it off? But the startup file may in fact change the
  default. For instance, using "follow_ftp = on" in _.wgetrc_ makes Wget
  _follow_ [.small]#FTP# links by default, and using *--no-follow-ftp*
  is the only way to restore the factory default from the command line.

*Basic Startup Options*

*-V* +
*--version*::
  Display the version of Wget.
*-h* +
*--help*::
  Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.
*-b* +
*--background*::
  Go to background immediately after startup. If no output file is
  specified via the *-o*, output is redirected to _wget-log_.
*-e* _command_ +
*--execute* _command_::
  Execute _command_ as if it were a part of _.wgetrc_. A command thus
  invoked will be executed _after_ the commands in _.wgetrc_, thus
  taking precedence over them. If you need to specify more than one
  wgetrc command, use multiple instances of *-e*.

*Logging and Input File Options*

*-o* _logfile_ +
*--output-file=*_logfile_::
  Log all messages to _logfile_. The messages are normally reported to
  standard error.
*-a* _logfile_ +
*--append-output=*_logfile_::
  Append to _logfile_. This is the same as *-o*, only it appends to
  _logfile_ instead of overwriting the old log file. If _logfile_ does
  not exist, a new file is created.
*-d* +
*--debug*::
  Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
  developers of Wget if it does not work properly. Your system
  administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug support,
  in which case *-d* will not work. Please note that compiling with
  debug support is always safe---Wget compiled with the debug support
  will _not_ print any debug info unless requested with *-d*.
*-q* +
*--quiet*::
  Turn off Wget's output.
*-v* +
*--verbose*::
  Turn on verbose output, with all the available data. The default
  output is verbose.
*-nv* +
*--no-verbose*::
  Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use *-q* for that),
  which means that error messages and basic information still get
  printed.
*-i* _file_ +
*--input-file=*_file_::
  Read URLs from a local or external _file_. If *-* is specified as
  _file_, URLs are read from the standard input. (Use *./-* to read from
  a file literally named *-*.)
  +
  If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command line.
  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input file, those
  on the command lines will be the first ones to be retrieved. If
  *--force-html* is not specified, then _file_ should consist of a
  series of URLs, one per line.
  +
  However, if you specify *--force-html*, the document will be regarded
  as *html*. In that case you may have problems with relative links,
  which you can solve either by adding "<base href=" _url_ ">" to the
  documents or by specifying *--base=*_url_ on the command line.
  +
  If the _file_ is an external one, the document will be automatically
  treated as *html* if the Content-Type matches *text/html*.
  Furthermore, the _file_'s location will be implicitly used as base
  href if none was specified.
*-F* +
*--force-html*::
  When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an
  [.small]#HTML# file. This enables you to retrieve relative links from
  existing [.small]#HTML# files on your local disk, by adding "<base
  href=" _url_ ">" to [.small]#HTML# , or using the *--base*
  command-line option.
*-B* _[.small]#URL#_ +
*--base=* _[.small]#URL#_::
  Resolves relative links using _[.small]#URL#_ as the point of
  reference, when reading links from an [.small]#HTML# file specified
  via the *-i*/*--input-file* option (together with *--force-html*, or
  when the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing it
  as [.small]#HTML# ). This is equivalent to the presence of a "BASE"
  tag in the [.small]#HTML# input file, with _[.small]#URL#_ as the
  value for the "href" attribute.
  +
  For instance, if you specify *http://foo/bar/a.html* for
  _[.small]#URL#_ , and Wget reads *../baz/b.html* from the input file,
  it would be resolved to *http://foo/baz/b.html*.

*Download Options*

*--bind-address=* _[.small]#ADDRESS#_::
  When making client [.small]#TCP/IP# connections, bind to
  _[.small]#ADDRESS#_ on the local machine. _[.small]#ADDRESS#_ may be
  specified as a hostname or [.small]#IP# address. This option can be
  useful if your machine is bound to multiple IPs.
*-t* _number_ +
*--tries=*_number_::
  Set number of retries to _number_. Specify 0 or *inf* for infinite
  retrying. The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of
  fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not found" (404), which are
  not retried.
*-O* _file_ +
*--output-document=*_file_::
  The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
  will be concatenated together and written to _file_. If *-* is used as
  _file_, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link
  conversion. (Use *./-* to print to a file literally named *-*.)
  +
  Use of *-O* is _not_ intended to mean simply "use the name _file_
  instead of the one in the [.small]#URL# ;" rather, it is analogous to
  shell redirection: *wget -O file http://foo* is intended to work like
  *wget -O - http://foo > file*; _file_ will be truncated immediately,
  and _all_ downloaded content will be written there.
  +
  For this reason, *-N* (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in
  combination with *-O*: since _file_ is always newly created, it will
  always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this
  combination is used.
  +
  Similarly, using *-r* or *-p* with *-O* may not work as you expect:
  Wget won't just download the first file to _file_ and then download
  the rest to their normal names: _all_ downloaded content will be
  placed in _file_. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been
  reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where
  this behavior can actually have some use.
  +
  Note that a combination with *-k* is only permitted when downloading a
  single document, as in that case it will just convert all relative
  URIs to external ones; *-k* makes no sense for multiple URIs when
  they're all being downloaded to a single file.
*-nc* +
*--no-clobber*::
  If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
  behavior depends on a few options, including *-nc*. In certain cases,
  the local file will be _clobbered_, or overwritten, upon repeated
  download. In other cases it will be preserved.
  +
  When running Wget without *-N*, *-nc*, *-r*, or *-p*, downloading the
  same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of
  _file_ being preserved and the second copy being named _file_*.1*. If
  that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named
  _file_*.2*, and so on. (This is also the behavior with *-nd*, even if
  *-r* or *-p* are in effect.) When *-nc* is specified, this behavior is
  suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of _file_.
  Therefore, ""no-clobber"" is actually a misnomer in this mode---it's
  not clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
  preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's
  prevented.
  +
  When running Wget with *-r* or *-p*, but without *-N*, *-nd*, or
  *-nc*, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
  overwriting the old. Adding *-nc* will prevent this behavior, instead
  causing the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on
  the server to be ignored.
  +
  When running Wget with *-N*, with or without *-r* or *-p*, the
  decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file
  depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file. *-nc*
  may not be specified at the same time as *-N*.
  +
  Note that when *-nc* is specified, files with the suffixes *.html* or
  *.htm* will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had
  been retrieved from the Web.
*-c* +
*--continue*::
  Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you
  want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget,
  or by another program. For instance:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
----
  +
  If there is a file named _ls-lR.Z_ in the current directory, Wget will
  assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask
  the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
  length of the local file.
  +
  Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the
  current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
  connection be lost midway through. This is the default behavior. *-c*
  only affects resumption of downloads started _prior_ to this
  invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.
  +
  Without *-c*, the previous example would just download the remote file
  to _ls-lR.Z.1_, leaving the truncated _ls-lR.Z_ file alone.
  +
  Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use *-c* on a non-empty file, and it
  turns out that the server does not support continued downloading, Wget
  will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
  effectively ruin existing contents. If you really want the download to
  start from scratch, remove the file.
  +
  Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use *-c* on a file which is of
  equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
  file and print an explanatory message. The same happens when the file
  is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was
  changed on the server since your last download attempt)---because
  "continuing" is not meaningful, no download occurs.
  +
  On the other side of the coin, while using *-c*, any file that's
  bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
  download and only "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be
  downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file. This behavior
  can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use *wget
  -c* to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data
  collection or log file.
  +
  However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
  _changed_, as opposed to just _appended_ to, you'll end up with a
  garbled file. Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
  really a valid prefix of the remote file. You need to be especially
  careful of this when using *-c* in conjunction with *-r*, since every
  file will be considered as an "incomplete download" candidate.
  +
  Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
  *-c* is if you have a lame [.small]#HTTP# proxy that inserts a
  "transfer interrupted" string into the local file. In the future a
  "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.
  +
  Note that *-c* only works with [.small]#FTP# servers and with
  [.small]#HTTP# servers that support the "Range" header.
*--progress=*_type_::
  Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use. Legal
  indicators are "dot" and "bar".
  +
  The "bar" indicator is used by default. It draws an [.small]#ASCII#
  progress bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) indicating the
  status of retrieval. If the output is not a [.small]#TTY# , the "dot"
  bar will be used by default.
  +
  Use *--progress=dot* to switch to the "dot" display. It traces the
  retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
  fixed amount of downloaded data.
  +
  When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the _style_ by
  specifying the type as *dot:*_style_. Different styles assign
  different meaning to one dot. With the "default" style each dot
  represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.
  The "binary" style has a more "computer"-like orientation---8K dots,
  16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines).
  The "mega" style is suitable for downloading very large files---each
  dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and
  48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).
  +
  Note that you can set the default style using the "progress" command
  in _.wgetrc_. That setting may be overridden from the command line.
  The exception is that, when the output is not a [.small]#TTY# , the
  "dot" progress will be favored over "bar". To force the bar output,
  use *--progress=bar:force*.
*-N* +
*--timestamping*::
  Turn on time-stamping.
*-S* +
*--server-response*::
  Print the headers sent by [.small]#HTTP# servers and responses sent by
  [.small]#FTP# servers.
*--spider*::
  When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web _spider_,
  which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they
  are there. For example, you can use Wget to check your bookmarks:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html
----
  +
  This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
  functionality of real web spiders.
*-T seconds* +
*--timeout=*_seconds_::
  Set the network timeout to _seconds_ seconds. This is equivalent to
  specifying *--dns-timeout*, *--connect-timeout*, and *--read-timeout*,
  all at the same time.
  +
  When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
  abort the operation if it takes too long. This prevents anomalies like
  hanging reads and infinite connects. The only timeout enabled by
  default is a 900-second read timeout. Setting a timeout to 0 disables
  it altogether. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to
  change the default timeout settings.
  +
  All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
  subsecond values. For example, *0.1* seconds is a legal (though
  unwise) choice of timeout. Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking
  server response times or for testing network latency.
*--dns-timeout=*_seconds_::
  Set the [.small]#DNS# lookup timeout to _seconds_ seconds.
  [.small]#DNS# lookups that don't complete within the specified time
  will fail. By default, there is no timeout on [.small]#DNS# lookups,
  other than that implemented by system libraries.
*--connect-timeout=*_seconds_::
  Set the connect timeout to _seconds_ seconds. [.small]#TCP#
  connections that take longer to establish will be aborted. By default,
  there is no connect timeout, other than that implemented by system
  libraries.
*--read-timeout=*_seconds_::
  Set the read (and write) timeout to _seconds_ seconds. The "time" of
  this timeout refers to _idle time_: if, at any point in the download,
  no data is received for more than the specified number of seconds,
  reading fails and the download is restarted. This option does not
  directly affect the duration of the entire download.
  +
  Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
  sooner than this option requires. The default read timeout is 900
  seconds.
*--limit-rate=*_amount_::
  Limit the download speed to _amount_ bytes per second. Amount may be
  expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the *k* suffix, or megabytes with
  the *m* suffix. For example, *--limit-rate=20k* will limit the
  retrieval rate to 20KB/s. This is useful when, for whatever reason,
  you don't want Wget to consume the entire available bandwidth.
  +
  This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction
  with power suffixes; for example, *--limit-rate=2.5k* is a legal
  value.
  +
  Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
  amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified
  by the rate. Eventually this strategy causes the [.small]#TCP#
  transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate. However, it
  may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be
  surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very small
  files.
*-w* _seconds_ +
*--wait=*_seconds_::
  Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals. Use of
  this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making
  the requests less frequent. Instead of in seconds, the time can be
  specified in minutes using the "m" suffix, in hours using "h" suffix,
  or in days using "d" suffix.
  +
  Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or
  the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
  reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry. The
  waiting interval specified by this function is influenced by
  "--random-wait", which see.
*--waitretry=*_seconds_::
  If you don't want Wget to wait between _every_ retrieval, but only
  between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option. Wget
  will use _linear backoff_, waiting 1 second after the first failure on
  a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on that
  file, up to the maximum number of _seconds_ you specify. Therefore, a
  value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55
  seconds per file.
  +
  By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.
*--random-wait*::
  Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs
  such as Wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in
  the time between requests. This option causes the time between
  requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * _wait_ seconds, where _wait_
  was specified using the *--wait* option, in order to mask Wget's
  presence from such analysis.
  +
  A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
  consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly.
  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure
  automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing
  DHCP-supplied addresses.
  +
  The *--random-wait* option was inspired by this ill-advised
  recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to
  the actions of one.
*--no-proxy*::
  Don't use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy environment
  variable is defined.
*-Q* _quota_ +
*--quota=*_quota_::
  Specify download quota for automatic retrievals. The value can be
  specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with *k* suffix), or
  megabytes (with *m* suffix).
  +
  Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file. So if you
  specify *wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz*, all of the
  _ls-lR.gz_ will be downloaded. The same goes even when several URLs
  are specified on the command-line. However, quota is respected when
  retrieving either recursively, or from an input file. Thus you may
  safely type *wget -Q2m -i sites*---download will be aborted when the
  quota is exceeded.
  +
  Setting quota to 0 or to *inf* unlimits the download quota.
*--no-dns-cache*::
  Turn off caching of [.small]#DNS# lookups. Normally, Wget remembers
  the [.small]#IP# addresses it looked up from [.small]#DNS# so it
  doesn't have to repeatedly contact the [.small]#DNS# server for the
  same (typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from. This cache
  exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact [.small]#DNS#
  again.
  +
  However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
  desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
  short-running application like Wget. With this option Wget issues a
  new [.small]#DNS# lookup (more precisely, a new call to
  "gethostbyname" or "getaddrinfo") each time it makes a new connection.
  Please note that this option will _not_ affect caching that might be
  performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer,
  such as [.small]#NSCD# .
  +
  If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you probably
  won't need it.
*--restrict-file-names=*_modes_::
  Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
  generation of local filenames. Characters that are _restricted_ by
  this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with *%HH*, where
  *[.small]#HH#* is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the
  restricted character. This option may also be used to force all
  alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase.
  +
  By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as
  part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
  characters that are typically unprintable. This option is useful for
  changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a
  non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the
  control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only
  those in the [.small]#ASCII# range of values.
  +
  The _modes_ are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable
  values are *unix*, *windows*, *nocontrol*, *ascii*, *lowercase*, and
  *uppercase*. The values *unix* and *windows* are mutually exclusive
  (one will override the other), as are *lowercase* and *uppercase*.
  Those last are special cases, as they do not change the set of
  characters that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to
  be converted either to lower- or uppercase.
  +
  When "unix" is specified, Wget escapes the character */* and the
  control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159. This is the
  default on Unix-like operating systems.
  +
  When "windows" is given, Wget escapes the characters *\*, *|*, */*,
  *:*, *?*, *"*, ***, *<*, *>*, and the control characters in the ranges
  0--31 and 128--159. In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses *+*
  instead of *:* to separate host and port in local file names, and uses
  *@* instead of *?* to separate the query portion of the file name from
  the rest. Therefore, a [.small]#URL# that would be saved as
  *www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah* in Unix mode would be saved
  as *www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah* in Windows mode. This
  mode is the default on Windows.
  +
  If you specify *nocontrol*, then the escaping of the control
  characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when you
  are downloading URLs whose names contain [.small]#UTF-8# characters,
  on a system which can save and display filenames in [.small]#UTF-8#
  (some possible byte values used in [.small]#UTF-8# byte sequences fall
  in the range of values designated by Wget as "controls").
  +
  The *ascii* mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are
  outside the range of [.small]#ASCII# characters (that is, greater than
  127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose
  encoding does not match the one used locally.
*-4* +
*--inet4-only* +
*-6* +
*--inet6-only*::
  Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. With *--inet4-only* or
  *-4*, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring [.small]#AAAA#
  records in [.small]#DNS# , and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses
  specified in URLs. Conversely, with *--inet6-only* or *-6*, Wget will
  only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.
  +
  Neither options should be needed normally. By default, an IPv6-aware
  Wget will use the address family specified by the host's [.small]#DNS#
  record. If the [.small]#DNS# responds with both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can
  connect to. (Also see "--prefer-family" option described below.)
  +
  These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
  IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging
  or to deal with broken network configuration. Only one of
  *--inet6-only* and *--inet4-only* may be specified at the same time.
  Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.
*--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6*::
  When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
  with specified address family first. The address order returned by
  [.small]#DNS# is used without change by default.
  +
  This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts
  that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4 networks. For
  example, *www.kame.net* resolves to
  *2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085* and to *203.178.141.194*. When
  the preferred family is "IPv4", the IPv4 address is used first; when
  the preferred family is "IPv6", the IPv6 address is used first; if the
  specified value is "none", the address order returned by [.small]#DNS#
  is used without change.
  +
  Unlike *-4* and *-6*, this option doesn't inhibit access to any
  address family, it only changes the _order_ in which the addresses are
  accessed. Also note that the reordering performed by this option is
  _stable_---it doesn't affect order of addresses of the same family.
  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6
  addresses remains intact in all cases.
*--retry-connrefused*::
  Consider "connection refused" a transient error and try again.
  Normally Wget gives up on a [.small]#URL# when it is unable to connect
  to the site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the
  server is not running at all and that retries would not help. This
  option is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to
  disappear for short periods of time.
*--user=*_user_ +
*--password=*_password_::
  Specify the username _user_ and password _password_ for both
  [.small]#FTP# and [.small]#HTTP# file retrieval. These parameters can
  be overridden using the *--ftp-user* and *--ftp-password* options for
  [.small]#FTP# connections and the *--http-user* and *--http-password*
  options for [.small]#HTTP# connections.
*--ask-password*::
  Prompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot be
  specified when *--password* is being used, because they are mutually
  exclusive.
*--no-iri*::
  Turn off internationalized [.small]#URI# ( [.small]#IRI# ) support.
  Use *--iri* to turn it on. [.small]#IRI# support is activated by
  default.
  +
  You can set the default state of [.small]#IRI# support using the "iri"
  command in _.wgetrc_. That setting may be overridden from the command
  line.
*--local-encoding=*_encoding_::
  Force Wget to use _encoding_ as the default system encoding. That
  affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale to
  [.small]#UTF-8# for [.small]#IRI# support.
  +
  Wget use the function "nl_langinfo()" and then the "CHARSET"
  environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, [.small]#ASCII#
  is used.
  +
  You can set the default local encoding using the "local_encoding"
  command in _.wgetrc_. That setting may be overridden from the command
  line.
*--remote-encoding=*_encoding_::
  Force Wget to use _encoding_ as the default remote server encoding.
  That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote
  encoding to [.small]#UTF-8# during a recursive fetch. This options is
  only useful for [.small]#IRI# support, for the interpretation of
  non-ASCII characters.
  +
  For [.small]#HTTP# , remote encoding can be found in [.small]#HTTP#
  "Content-Type" header and in [.small]#HTML# "Content-Type http-equiv"
  meta tag.
  +
  You can set the default encoding using the "remoteencoding" command in
  _.wgetrc_. That setting may be overridden from the command line.

*Directory Options*

*-nd* +
*--no-directories*::
  Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving recursively.
  With this option turned on, all files will get saved to the current
  directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up more than once, the
  filenames will get extensions *.n*).
*-x* +
*--force-directories*::
  The opposite of *-nd*---create a hierarchy of directories, even if one
  would not have been created otherwise. E.g. *wget -x
  http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt* will save the downloaded file to
  _fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt_.
*-nH* +
*--no-host-directories*::
  Disable generation of host-prefixed directories. By default, invoking
  Wget with *-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/* will create a structure of
  directories beginning with _fly.srk.fer.hr/_. This option disables
  such behavior.
*--protocol-directories*::
  Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names.
  For example, with this option, *wget -r http://*_host_ will save to
  *http/*_host_*/...* rather than just to _host_*/...*.
*--cut-dirs=*_number_::
  Ignore _number_ directory components. This is useful for getting a
  fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will
  be saved.
  +
  Take, for example, the directory at
  *ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/*. If you retrieve it with *-r*, it
  will be saved locally under _ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/_. While the
  *-nH* option can remove the _ftp.xemacs.org/_ part, you are still
  stuck with _pub/xemacs_. This is where *--cut-dirs* comes in handy; it
  makes Wget not "see" _number_ remote directory components. Here are
  several examples of how *--cut-dirs* option works.
  +
[source,code]
----
No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
-nH               -> pub/xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

--cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
...
----
  +
  If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option is
  similar to a combination of *-nd* and *-P*. However, unlike *-nd*,
  *--cut-dirs* does not lose with subdirectories---for instance, with
  *-nH --cut-dirs=1*, a _beta/_ subdirectory will be placed to
  _xemacs/beta_, as one would expect.
*-P* _prefix_ +
*--directory-prefix=*_prefix_::
  Set directory prefix to _prefix_. The _directory prefix_ is the
  directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to,
  i.e. the top of the retrieval tree. The default is *.* (the current
  directory).

*[.small]#HTTP# Options*

*--default-page=*_name_::
  Use _name_ as the default file name when it isn't known (i.e., for
  URLs that end in a slash), instead of _index.html_.
*-E* +
*--adjust-extension*::
  If a file of type *application/xhtml+xml* or *text/html* is downloaded
  and the [.small]#URL# does not end with the regexp
  *\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?*, this option will cause the suffix *.html* to be
  appended to the local filename. This is useful, for instance, when
  you're mirroring a remote site that uses *.asp* pages, but you want
  the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server. Another
  good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.
  A [.small]#URL# like *http://site.com/article.cgi?25* will be saved as
  _article.cgi?25.html_.
  +
  Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every
  time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
  _X.html_ file corresponds to remote [.small]#URL# _X_ (since it
  doesn't yet know that the [.small]#URL# produces output of type
  *text/html* or *application/xhtml+xml*. To prevent this
  re-downloading, you must use *-k* and *-K* so that the original
  version of the file will be saved as _X.orig_.
  +
  As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files of
  type *text/css* end in the suffix *.css*, and the option was renamed
  from *--html-extension*, to better reflect its new behavior. The old
  option name is still acceptable, but should now be considered
  deprecated.
  +
  At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded to
  include suffixes for other types of content, including content types
  that are not parsed by Wget.
*--http-user=*_user_ +
*--http-password=*_password_::
  Specify the username _user_ and password _password_ on an
  [.small]#HTTP# server. According to the type of the challenge, Wget
  will encode them using either the "basic" (insecure), the "digest", or
  the Windows "NTLM" authentication scheme.
  +
  Another way to specify username and password is in the [.small]#URL#
  itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to
  run "ps". To prevent the passwords from being seen, store them in
  _.wgetrc_ or _.netrc_, and make sure to protect those files from other
  users with "chmod". If the passwords are really important, do not
  leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete
  them after Wget has started the download.
*--no-http-keep-alive*::
  Turn off the "keep-alive" feature for [.small]#HTTP# downloads.
  Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that,
  when you download more than one document from the same server, they
  get transferred over the same [.small]#TCP# connection. This saves
  time and at the same time reduces the load on the server.
  +
  This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive)
  connections don't work for you, for example due to a server bug or due
  to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.
*--no-cache*::
  Disable server-side cache. In this case, Wget will send the remote
  server an appropriate directive (*Pragma: no-cache*) to get the file
  from the remote service, rather than returning the cached version.
  This is especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date
  documents on proxy servers.
  +
  Caching is allowed by default.
*--no-cookies*::
  Disable the use of cookies. Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining
  server-side state. The server sends the client a cookie using the
  "Set-Cookie" header, and the client responds with the same cookie upon
  further requests. Since cookies allow the server owners to keep track
  of visitors and for sites to exchange this information, some consider
  them a breach of privacy. The default is to use cookies; however,
  _storing_ cookies is not on by default.
*--load-cookies* _file_::
  Load cookies from _file_ before the first [.small]#HTTP# retrieval.
  _file_ is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
  _cookies.txt_ file.
  +
  You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
  that you be logged in to access some or all of their content. The
  login process typically works by the web server issuing an
  [.small]#HTTP# cookie upon receiving and verifying your credentials.
  The cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing that part of
  the site, and so proves your identity.
  +
  Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
  browser sends when communicating with the site. This is achieved by
  *--load-cookies*---simply point Wget to the location of the
  _cookies.txt_ file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
  would send in the same situation. Different browsers keep textual
  cookie files in different locations:
  +
  Netscape 4.x.
  +
  The cookies are in _~/.netscape/cookies.txt_.
  +
  Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
  +
  Mozilla's cookie file is also named _cookies.txt_, located somewhere
  under _~/.mozilla_, in the directory of your profile. The full path
  usually ends up looking somewhat like
  _~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt_.
  +
  Internet Explorer.
  +
  You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File menu,
  Import and Export, Export Cookies. This has been tested with Internet
  Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions.
  +
  Other browsers.
  +
  If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
  *--load-cookies* will only work if you can locate or produce a cookie
  file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.
  +
  If you cannot use *--load-cookies*, there might still be an
  alternative. If your browser supports a "cookie manager", you can use
  it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're mirroring.
  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct
  Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the "official" cookie support:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: <name>=<value>"
----
*--save-cookies* _file_::
  Save cookies to _file_ before exiting. This will not save cookies that
  have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called "session
  cookies"), but also see *--keep-session-cookies*.
*--keep-session-cookies*::
  When specified, causes *--save-cookies* to also save session cookies.
  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be
  kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser. Saving them is
  useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the home page
  before you can access some pages. With this option, multiple Wget runs
  are considered a single browser session as far as the site is
  concerned.
  +
  Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies,
  Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0. Wget's *--load-cookies*
  recognizes those as session cookies, but it might confuse other
  browsers. Also note that cookies so loaded will be treated as other
  session cookies, which means that if you want *--save-cookies* to
  preserve them again, you must use *--keep-session-cookies* again.
*--ignore-length*::
  Unfortunately, some [.small]#HTTP# servers ( [.small]#CGI# programs,
  to be more precise) send out bogus "Content-Length" headers, which
  makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.
  You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document
  again and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
  connection has closed on the very same byte.
  +
  With this option, Wget will ignore the "Content-Length" header---as if
  it never existed.
*--header=*_header-line_::
  Send _header-line_ along with the rest of the headers in each
  [.small]#HTTP# request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which means
  it must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not
  contain newlines.
  +
  You may define more than one additional header by specifying
  *--header* more than once.
  +
[source,code]
----
wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
     --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
       http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
----
  +
  Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
  previous user-defined headers.
  +
  As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise
  generated automatically. This example instructs Wget to connect to
  localhost, but to specify *foo.bar* in the "Host" header:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/
----
  +
  In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of *--header* caused
  sending of duplicate headers.
*--max-redirect=*_number_::
  Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a resource.
  The default is 20, which is usually far more than necessary. However,
  on those occasions where you want to allow more (or fewer), this is
  the option to use.
*--proxy-user=*_user_ +
*--proxy-password=*_password_::
  Specify the username _user_ and password _password_ for authentication
  on a proxy server. Wget will encode them using the "basic"
  authentication scheme.
  +
  Security considerations similar to those with *--http-password*
  pertain here as well.
*--referer=*_url_::
  Include 'Referer: _url_' header in [.small]#HTTP# request. Useful for
  retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they are
  always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only come out
  properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that point to them.
*--save-headers*::
  Save the headers sent by the [.small]#HTTP# server to the file,
  preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.
*-U* _agent-string_ +
*--user-agent=*_agent-string_::
  Identify as _agent-string_ to the [.small]#HTTP# server.
  +
  The [.small]#HTTP# protocol allows the clients to identify themselves
  using a "User-Agent" header field. This enables distinguishing the
  [.small]#WWW# software, usually for statistical purposes or for
  tracing of protocol violations. Wget normally identifies as
  *Wget/*_version_, _version_ being the current version number of Wget.
  +
  However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
  the output according to the "User-Agent"-supplied information. While
  this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by servers
  denying information to clients other than (historically) Netscape or,
  more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer. This option allows you
  to change the "User-Agent" line issued by Wget. Use of this option is
  discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.
  +
  Specifying empty user agent with *--user-agent=""* instructs Wget not
  to send the "User-Agent" header in [.small]#HTTP# requests.
*--post-data=*_string_ +
*--post-file=*_file_::
  Use [.small]#POST# as the method for all [.small]#HTTP# requests and
  send the specified data in the request body. *--post-data* sends
  _string_ as data, whereas *--post-file* sends the contents of _file_.
  Other than that, they work in exactly the same way. In particular,
  they _both_ expect content of the form "key1=value1&key2=value2", with
  percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is that
  one expects its content as a command-line paramter and the other
  accepts its content from a file. In particular, *--post-file* is _not_
  for transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as
  "key=value" data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like
  everything else. Wget does not currently support "multipart/form-data"
  for transmitting [.small]#POST# data; only
  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Only one of *--post-data* and
  *--post-file* should be specified.
  +
  Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the [.small]#POST#
  data in advance. Therefore the argument to "--post-file" must be a
  regular file; specifying a [.small]#FIFO# or something like
  _/dev/stdin_ won't work. It's not quite clear how to work around this
  limitation inherent in [.small]#HTTP/1# .0. Although [.small]#HTTP/1#
  .1 introduces _chunked_ transfer that doesn't require knowing the
  request length in advance, a client can't use chunked unless it knows
  it's talking to an [.small]#HTTP/1# .1 server. And it can't know that
  until it receives a response, which in turn requires the request to
  have been completed -- a chicken-and-egg problem.
  +
  Note: if Wget is redirected after the [.small]#POST# request is
  completed, it will not send the [.small]#POST# data to the redirected
  [.small]#URL# . This is because URLs that process [.small]#POST# often
  respond with a redirection to a regular page, which does not desire or
  accept [.small]#POST# . It is not completely clear that this behavior
  is optimal; if it doesn't work out, it might be changed in the future.
  +
  This example shows how to log to a server using [.small]#POST# and
  then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
  to authorized users:
  +
[source,code]
----
# Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
     --post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \
     http://server.com/auth.php

# Now grab the page or pages we care about.
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
     -p http://server.com/interesting/article.php
----
  +
  If the server is using session cookies to track user authentication,
  the above will not work because *--save-cookies* will not save them
  (and neither will browsers) and the _cookies.txt_ file will be empty.
  In that case use *--keep-session-cookies* along with *--save-cookies*
  to force saving of session cookies.
*--content-disposition*::
  If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support for
  "Content-Disposition" headers is enabled. This can currently result in
  extra round-trips to the server for a "HEAD" request, and is known to
  suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by
  default.
  +
  This option is useful for some file-downloading [.small]#CGI# programs
  that use "Content-Disposition" headers to describe what the name of a
  downloaded file should be.
*--auth-no-challenge*::
  If this option is given, Wget will send Basic [.small]#HTTP#
  authentication information (plaintext username and password) for all
  requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.
  +
  Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to support
  some few obscure servers, which never send [.small]#HTTP#
  authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say, in
  addition to form-based authentication.

*[.small]#HTTPS# ( [.small]#SSL/TLS# ) Options*

To support encrypted [.small]#HTTP# ( [.small]#HTTPS# ) downloads, Wget
must be compiled with an external [.small]#SSL# library, currently
OpenSSL. If Wget is compiled without [.small]#SSL# support, none of
these options are available. +
*--secure-protocol=*_protocol_::
  Choose the secure protocol to be used. Legal values are *auto*,
  *SSLv2*, *SSLv3*, and *TLSv1*. If *auto* is used, the [.small]#SSL#
  library is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol
  automatically, which is achieved by sending an SSLv2 greeting and
  announcing support for SSLv3 and TLSv1. This is the default.
  +
  Specifying *SSLv2*, *SSLv3*, or *TLSv1* forces the use of the
  corresponding protocol. This is useful when talking to old and buggy
  [.small]#SSL# server implementations that make it hard for OpenSSL to
  choose the correct protocol version. Fortunately, such servers are
  quite rare.
*--no-check-certificate*::
  Don't check the server certificate against the available certificate
  authorities. Also don't require the [.small]#URL# host name to match
  the common name presented by the certificate.
  +
  As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
  against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the
  [.small]#SSL# handshake and aborting the download if the verification
  fails. Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
  interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
  versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise
  invalid certificates. This option forces an "insecure" mode of
  operation that turns the certificate verification errors into warnings
  and allows you to proceed.
  +
  If you encounter "certificate verification" errors or ones saying that
  "common name doesn't match requested host name", you can use this
  option to bypass the verification and proceed with the download. _Only
  use this option if you are otherwise convinced of the site's
  authenticity, or if you really don't care about the validity of its
  certificate._ It is almost always a bad idea not to check the
  certificates when transmitting confidential or important data.
*--certificate=*_file_::
  Use the client certificate stored in _file_. This is needed for
  servers that are configured to require certificates from the clients
  that connect to them. Normally a certificate is not required and this
  switch is optional.
*--certificate-type=*_type_::
  Specify the type of the client certificate. Legal values are
  *[.small]#PEM#* (assumed by default) and *[.small]#DER#* , also known
  as *[.small]#ASN1#* .
*--private-key=*_file_::
  Read the private key from _file_. This allows you to provide the
  private key in a file separate from the certificate.
*--private-key-type=*_type_::
  Specify the type of the private key. Accepted values are
  *[.small]#PEM#* (the default) and *[.small]#DER#* .
*--ca-certificate=*_file_::
  Use _file_ as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities ("
  [.small]#CA# ") to verify the peers. The certificates must be in
  [.small]#PEM# format.
  +
  Without this option Wget looks for [.small]#CA# certificates at the
  system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.
*--ca-directory=*_directory_::
  Specifies directory containing [.small]#CA# certificates in
  [.small]#PEM# format. Each file contains one [.small]#CA# certificate,
  and the file name is based on a hash value derived from the
  certificate. This is achieved by processing a certificate directory
  with the "c_rehash" utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using
  *--ca-directory* is more efficient than *--ca-certificate* when many
  certificates are installed because it allows Wget to fetch
  certificates on demand.
  +
  Without this option Wget looks for [.small]#CA# certificates at the
  system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.
*--random-file=*_file_::
  Use _file_ as the source of random data for seeding the pseudo-random
  number generator on systems without _/dev/random_.
  +
  On such systems the [.small]#SSL# library needs an external source of
  randomness to initialize. Randomness may be provided by [.small]#EGD#
  (see *--egd-file* below) or read from an external source specified by
  the user. If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random data
  in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in _$HOME__/.rnd_. If none of those
  are available, it is likely that [.small]#SSL# encryption will not be
  usable.
  +
  If you're getting the "Could not seed OpenSSL [.small]#PRNG# ;
  disabling [.small]#SSL# ." error, you should provide random data using
  some of the methods described above.
*--egd-file=*_file_::
  Use _file_ as the [.small]#EGD# socket. [.small]#EGD# stands for
  _Entropy Gathering Daemon_, a user-space program that collects data
  from various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to
  other programs that might need it. Encryption software, such as the
  [.small]#SSL# library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to
  seed the random number generator used to produce cryptographically
  strong keys.
  +
  OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using the
  "RAND_FILE" environment variable. If this variable is unset, or if the
  specified file does not produce enough randomness, OpenSSL will read
  random data from [.small]#EGD# socket specified using this option.
  +
  If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command is
  not used), [.small]#EGD# is never contacted. [.small]#EGD# is not
  needed on modern Unix systems that support _/dev/random_.

*[.small]#FTP# Options*

*--ftp-user=*_user_ +
*--ftp-password=*_password_::
  Specify the username _user_ and password _password_ on an
  [.small]#FTP# server. Without this, or the corresponding startup
  option, the password defaults to *-wget@*, normally used for anonymous
  [.small]#FTP# .
  +
  Another way to specify username and password is in the [.small]#URL#
  itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to
  run "ps". To prevent the passwords from being seen, store them in
  _.wgetrc_ or _.netrc_, and make sure to protect those files from other
  users with "chmod". If the passwords are really important, do not
  leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete
  them after Wget has started the download.
*--no-remove-listing*::
  Don't remove the temporary _.listing_ files generated by [.small]#FTP#
  retrievals. Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
  received from [.small]#FTP# servers. Not removing them can be useful
  for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on
  the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a
  mirror you're running is complete).
  +
  Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file,
  this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
  _.listing_ a symbolic link to _/etc/passwd_ or something and asking
  "root" to run Wget in his or her directory. Depending on the options
  used, either Wget will refuse to write to _.listing_, making the
  globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the symbolic link
  will be deleted and replaced with the actual _.listing_ file, or the
  listing will be written to a _.listing.number_ file.
  +
  Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, "root" should
  never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory. A user could do
  something as simple as linking _index.html_ to _/etc/passwd_ and
  asking "root" to run Wget with *-N* or *-r* so the file will be
  overwritten.
*--no-glob*::
  Turn off [.small]#FTP# globbing. Globbing refers to the use of
  shell-like special characters (_wildcards_), like ***, *?*, *[* and
  *]* to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once,
  like:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
----
  +
  By default, globbing will be turned on if the [.small]#URL# contains a
  globbing character. This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
  permanently.
  +
  You may have to quote the [.small]#URL# to protect it from being
  expanded by your shell. Globbing makes Wget look for a directory
  listing, which is system-specific. This is why it currently works only
  with Unix [.small]#FTP# servers (and the ones emulating Unix "ls"
  output).
*--no-passive-ftp*::
  Disable the use of the _passive_ [.small]#FTP# transfer mode. Passive
  [.small]#FTP# mandates that the client connect to the server to
  establish the data connection rather than the other way around.
  +
  If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and
  active [.small]#FTP# should work equally well. Behind most firewall
  and [.small]#NAT# configurations passive [.small]#FTP# has a better
  chance of working. However, in some rare firewall configurations,
  active [.small]#FTP# actually works when passive [.small]#FTP#
  doesn't. If you suspect this to be the case, use this option, or set
  "passive_ftp=off" in your init file.
*--retr-symlinks*::
  Usually, when retrieving [.small]#FTP# directories recursively and a
  symbolic link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.
  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.
  The pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive
  retrieval would have encountered it separately and downloaded it
  anyway.
  +
  When *--retr-symlinks* is specified, however, symbolic links are
  traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved. At this time, this
  option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and
  recurse through them, but in the future it should be enhanced to do
  this.
  +
  Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
  specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
  this option has no effect. Symbolic links are always traversed in this
  case.

*Recursive Retrieval Options*

*-r* +
*--recursive*::
  Turn on recursive retrieving.
*-l* _depth_ +
*--level=*_depth_::
  Specify recursion maximum depth level _depth_. The default maximum
  depth is 5.
*--delete-after*::
  This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
  _after_ having done so. It is useful for pre-fetching popular pages
  through a proxy, e.g.:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
----
  +
  The *-r* option is to retrieve recursively, and *-nd* to not create
  directories.
  +
  Note that *--delete-after* deletes files on the local machine. It does
  not issue the *[.small]#DELE#* command to remote [.small]#FTP# sites,
  for instance. Also note that when *--delete-after* is specified,
  *--convert-links* is ignored, so *.orig* files are simply not created
  in the first place.
*-k* +
*--convert-links*::
  After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
  make them suitable for local viewing. This affects not only the
  visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
  external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
  hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.
  +
  Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:
  +
  • The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed
  to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.
  +
  Example: if the downloaded file _/foo/doc.html_ links to
  _/bar/img.gif_, also downloaded, then the link in _doc.html_ will be
  modified to point to *../bar/img.gif*. This kind of transformation
  works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.
  +
  • The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be
  changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they
  point to.
  +
  Example: if the downloaded file _/foo/doc.html_ links to
  _/bar/img.gif_ (or to _../bar/img.gif_), then the link in _doc.html_
  will be modified to point to http://hostname/bar/img.gif.
  +
  Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
  downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
  downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather
  than presenting a broken link. The fact that the former links are
  converted to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded
  hierarchy to another directory.
  +
  Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links
  have been downloaded. Because of that, the work done by *-k* will be
  performed at the end of all the downloads.
*-K* +
*--backup-converted*::
  When converting a file, back up the original version with a *.orig*
  suffix. Affects the behavior of *-N*.
*-m* +
*--mirror*::
  Turn on options suitable for mirroring. This option turns on recursion
  and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps
  [.small]#FTP# directory listings. It is currently equivalent to *-r -N
  -l inf --no-remove-listing*.
*-p* +
*--page-requisites*::
  This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary
  to properly display a given [.small]#HTML# page. This includes such
  things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
  +
  Ordinarily, when downloading a single [.small]#HTML# page, any
  requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
  downloaded. Using *-r* together with *-l* can help, but since Wget
  does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
  documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
  missing their requisites.
  +
  For instance, say document _1.html_ contains an "<IMG>" tag
  referencing _1.gif_ and an "<A>" tag pointing to external document
  _2.html_. Say that _2.html_ is similar but that its image is _2.gif_
  and it links to _3.html_. Say this continues up to some arbitrarily
  high number.
  +
  If one executes the command:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -r -l 2 http://<site>/1.html
----
  +
  then _1.html_, _1.gif_, _2.html_, _2.gif_, and _3.html_ will be
  downloaded. As you can see, _3.html_ is without its requisite _3.gif_
  because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from
  _1.html_ in order to determine where to stop the recursion. However,
  with this command:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -r -l 2 -p http://<site>/1.html
----
  +
  all the above files _and 3.html_'s requisite _3.gif_ will be
  downloaded. Similarly,
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -r -l 1 -p http://<site>/1.html
----
  +
  will cause _1.html_, _1.gif_, _2.html_, and _2.gif_ to be downloaded.
  One might think that:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -r -l 0 -p http://<site>/1.html
----
  +
  would download just _1.html_ and _1.gif_, but unfortunately this is
  not the case, because *-l 0* is equivalent to *-l inf*---that is,
  infinite recursion. To download a single [.small]#HTML# page (or a
  handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a *-i*
  [.small]#URL# input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave
  off *-r* and *-l*:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -p http://<site>/1.html
----
  +
  Note that Wget will behave as if *-r* had been specified, but only
  that single page and its requisites will be downloaded. Links from
  that page to external documents will not be followed. Actually, to
  download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on
  separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally,
  this author likes to use a few options in addition to *-p*:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<site>/<document>
----
  +
  To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
  external document link is any [.small]#URL# specified in an "<A>" tag,
  an "<AREA>" tag, or a "<LINK>" tag other than "<LINK
  REL="stylesheet">".
*--strict-comments*::
  Turn on strict parsing of [.small]#HTML# comments. The default is to
  terminate comments at the first occurrence of *-->*.
  +
  According to specifications, [.small]#HTML# comments are expressed as
  [.small]#SGML# _declarations_. Declaration is special markup that
  begins with *<!* and ends with *>*, such as *<!DOCTYPE ...>*, that may
  contain comments between a pair of *--* delimiters. [.small]#HTML#
  comments are "empty declarations", [.small]#SGML# declarations without
  any non-comment text. Therefore, *<!--foo-->* is a valid comment, and
  so is *<!--one-- --two-->*, but *<!--1--2-->* is not.
  +
  On the other hand, most [.small]#HTML# writers don't perceive comments
  as anything other than text delimited with *<!--* and *-->*, which is
  not quite the same. For example, something like *<!------------>*
  works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple
  of four (!). If not, the comment technically lasts until the next
  *--*, which may be at the other end of the document. Because of this,
  many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
  implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
  *<!--* and *-->*.
  +
  Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted
  in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers,
  but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments. Beginning
  with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements
  "naive" comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
  *-->*.
  +
  If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
  option to turn it on.

*Recursive Accept/Reject Options*

*-A* _acclist_ *--accept* _acclist_ +
*-R* _rejlist_ *--reject* _rejlist_::
  Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
  accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, ***,
  *?*, *[* or *]*, appear in an element of _acclist_ or _rejlist_, it
  will be treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.
*-D* _domain-list_ +
*--domains=*_domain-list_::
  Set domains to be followed. _domain-list_ is a comma-separated list of
  domains. Note that it does _not_ turn on *-H*.
*--exclude-domains* _domain-list_::
  Specify the domains that are _not_ to be followed..
*--follow-ftp*::
  Follow [.small]#FTP# links from [.small]#HTML# documents. Without this
  option, Wget will ignore all the [.small]#FTP# links.
*--follow-tags=*_list_::
  Wget has an internal table of [.small]#HTML# tag / attribute pairs
  that it considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
  retrieval. If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
  considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
  comma-separated _list_ with this option.
*--ignore-tags=*_list_::
  This is the opposite of the *--follow-tags* option. To skip certain
  [.small]#HTML# tags when recursively looking for documents to
  download, specify them in a comma-separated _list_.
  +
  In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single
  page and its requisites, using a command-line like:
  +
[source,code]
----
wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://<site>/<document>
----
  +
  However, the author of this option came across a page with tags like
  "<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">" and came to the realization that
  specifying tags to ignore was not enough. One can't just tell Wget to
  ignore "<LINK>", because then stylesheets will not be downloaded. Now
  the best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the
  dedicated *--page-requisites* option.
*--ignore-case*::
  Ignore case when matching files and directories. This influences the
  behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing
  implemented when downloading from [.small]#FTP# sites. For example,
  with this option, *-A *.txt* will match *file1.txt*, but also
  *file2.TXT*, *file3.TxT*, and so on.
*-H* +
*--span-hosts*::
  Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.
*-L* +
*--relative*::
  Follow relative links only. Useful for retrieving a specific home page
  without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts.
*-I* _list_ +
*--include-directories=*_list_::
  Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow when
  downloading. Elements of _list_ may contain wildcards.
*-X* _list_ +
*--exclude-directories=*_list_::
  Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude from
  download. Elements of _list_ may contain wildcards.
*-np* +
*--no-parent*::
  Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
  recursively. This is a useful option, since it guarantees that only
  the files _below_ a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.

=== Exit Status

Wget may return one of several error codes if it encounters problems.

0 +
No problems occurred. +
1 +
Generic error code. +
2 +
Parse error---for instance, when parsing command-line options, the
*.wgetrc* or *.netrc*... +
3 +
File I/O error. +
4 +
Network failure. +
5 +
[.small]#SSL# verification failure. +
6 +
Username/password authentication failure. +
7 +
Protocol errors. +
8 +
Server issued an error response.

With the exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes take
precedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of errors are
encountered. +
In versions of Wget prior to 1.12, Wget's exit status tended to be
unhelpful and inconsistent. Recursive downloads would virtually always
return 0 (success), regardless of any issues encountered, and
non-recursive fetches only returned the status corresponding to the most
recently-attempted download.

=== Files

*/etc/wgetrc*

Default location of the _global_ startup file.

*.wgetrc*

User startup file.

=== Bugs

You are welcome to submit bug reports via the [.small]#GNU# Wget bug
tracker (see <**http://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker**>).

Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

1. +
Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug. If
Wget crashes, it's a bug. If Wget does not behave as documented, it's a
bug. If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way they are
supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to
double-check the documentation and the mailing lists. +
2. +
Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible. E.g. if
Wget crashes while downloading *wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy
http://yoyodyne.com -o /tmp/log*, you should try to see if the crash is
repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options. You might
even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to
see if that page somehow triggered the crash.

Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
_.wgetrc_ file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably a bad
idea. Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats with
_.wgetrc_ moved out of the way. Only if it turns out that _.wgetrc_
settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file.

3. +
Please start Wget with *-d* option and send us the resulting output (or
relevant parts thereof). If Wget was compiled without debug support,
recompile it---it is _much_ easier to trace bugs with debug support on.

Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information
from the debug log before sending it to the bug address. The "-d" won't
go out of its way to collect sensitive information, but the log _will_
contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget's communication with the
server, which may include passwords and pieces of downloaded data. Since
the bug address is publically archived, you may assume that all bug
reports are visible to the public.

4. +
If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. "gdb `which wget`
core" and type "where" to get the backtrace. This may not work if the
system administrator has disabled core files, but it is safe to try.

=== See Also

This is *not* the complete manual for [.small]#GNU# Wget. For more
complete information, including more detailed explanations of some of
the options, and a number of commands available for use with _.wgetrc_
files and the *-e* option, see the [.small]#GNU# Info entry for _wget_.
