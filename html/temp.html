        includes any running footers. The default value is 7. The
        argument specifies a template <small>URL</small> for

        additional information. The argument specifies a Perl

        value is 0. By default, merges multi-page formatted nroff

        lines making up the page size (length) of the formatted

        been specified, then this option restricts the creation of
        links to other manual pages to the section only. If the
        option has been specified, then this option modifies its
        operation to process the alternate manual page keyword

        See the section below for additional information. Do not
        require a section head to have bold overstriking in the

        on a Sun workstation that section heads in manpages were
        found to not be overstruck. By default, does not generate a

        specifies number number of lines representing the top
        margin of the formatted nroff input. The line count
        includes any running headers. The default value is 7. Use
        as the name of the element to wrap underscored characters.
        The default is <b>I</b>. The option may be used to
        customize which <small>HTML</small> header tags, are used
        in manpage section headings. Normally, treats lines that
        are flush to the left margin and contain overstriking
        (overstrike check is canceled with the option), as section
        heads. However, you can augment/override what
        <small>HTML</small> header tags are used for any given
        section head. In order to write a section head map file,
        you will need to know about associative arrays. You do not
        need to be an expert in to write a map file, however,
        having knowledge of allows you to be more clever. To add to

        <p valign="top">Check the source code of for the latest
        default mapping. You can reassign the variable to a
        different value if you choose. This value is used as the
        header tag of a section head if no matches are found in the
        <b>%SectionHead</b> map. You may have noticed unusual
        characters in the default map file, like "\s" or "*". The
        utility actual treats the as a regular expression. If you
        are comfortable with regular expressions, then you have
        their full power to use in your map file. The utility
        already anchors the regular expression to the beginning of
        the line with left margin spacing specified by the option.
        Therefore, do not use the ‘^’ character to anchor your
        regular expression to the beginning. However, you may end
        your expression with a ‘<b>$</b>’ to anchor it to the end
        of the line. Since the is actually a regular expression,
        you will have to be careful of special characters if you
        want them to be treated literally. Any of the characters
        should be escaped by prefixing them by the ‘<b>\</b>’
        character if you want to treat them "as is". One should use
        single quotes instead of double quotes to delimit This will
        preserve any ‘<b>\</b>’ characters for character escaping
        or when the ‘<b>\</b>’ is used for special character
        matching sequences (e.g., <b>\s</b>, <b>\w</b>, <b>\S</b>).
        Comments can be inserted in the map file by using the
        ’<b>#</b>’ character. Anything after, and including, the
        ’<b>#</b>’ character is ignored, up to the end of line. You
        might be thinking that the above is quite-a-bit-of-stuff
        just for doing manpage section heads. However, you will be
        surprised how much better the <small>HTML</small> output
        looks with header tags, even though, everything else is in
        a tag. The utility allows the ability to link to other
        manpage references. If the option is specified, will create
        anchors that link to other manpages. The <small>URL</small>
        entered with the option is actually a template that
        determines the actual <small>URL</small> used to link to
        other manpages. The following variables are defined during
        run time that may be used in the template string:</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The title of the
        manual page referenced. The section number of the manual
        page referenced. The subsection of the manual page
        referenced. Any other text in the template is preserved "as
        is". The utility evaluates the template string as a string
        expression. Therefore, one might need to surround the
        variable names with ’<b>{}</b>’ (e.g., so that properly
        recognizes the variable. If a <small>CGI</small> program
        calling is actually a shell script or a program, make sure
        to properly escape the ’<b>$</b>’ character in the
        <small>URL</small> template to avoid variable interpolation
        by the <small>CGI</small> program. Normally, the
        <small>URL</small> calls a <small>CGI</small> program
        (hence the option name), but the <small>URL</small> can
        easily link to statically converted documents. The
        following template string is specified to call a
        <small>CGI</small> program to retrieve the appropriate
        manpage linked to:<br>
        If the manpage is referenced in the section, the above
        template will translate to the following <small>URL</small>
        : The actual <small>HTML</small> markup will look like the
        following:
        <b>&lt;A&nbsp;HREF="/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=1&amp;topic=ls"&gt;ls(1)&lt;/A&gt;</b>
        The following template string is specified to retrieve
        pre-converted manpages: If the manpage is referenced, the
        above template will translate to the following
        <small>URL</small> : The actual <small>HTML</small> markup
        will look like the following: <b>&lt;A
        HREF="http://foo.org/man1/mount.1M.html"&gt;mount(1M)&lt;/A&gt;</b>
        The option is a more general form of the option. allows one
        to specify a general Perl expression. For example:
        <b>$title=~/^db_/i?"$title.html":"/cgi-bin/man?$title+$section"</b>
        A can be expressed as follows with <b>-cgiurlexp</b>:
        <b>return "</b><i>string</i><b>"</b> The utility has the
        ability to process keyword search output generated by the
        <b>man&nbsp;-k</b> or <b>apropos</b> commands, through the
        use of the option. The utility will generate an
        <small>HTML</small> document of the keyword search input
        having the following format: • All manpage references are
        listed by section. • Within each section listing, the
        manpage references are sorted alphabetically
        (case-sensitive) in a tag. The manpage references are
        listed in the section, and the summary text is listed in
        the section. • Each manpage reference listed is a hyperlink
        to the actual manpage as specified by the option. This
        ability to process keyword searches gives nice added
        functionality to a <small>WWW</small> forms interface to
        Even if you have statically converted manpages to
        <small>HTML</small> via another man-&gt;
        <small>HTML</small> program, you can use and
        "<b>man&nbsp;-k</b>" to provide keyword search capabilities
        easily for your <small>HTML</small> manpages.
        Unfortunately, there is no standard controlling the format
        of keyword search results. The utility tries it best to
        handle all the variations. However, the keyword search
        results generated by the operating system is different
        enough from other systems that a special command-line
        option must be specified to handle its output.</p>

        shouldn’t be merged when depaginates the text. To avoid
        this problem, keeps track of the margin indent right before
        and after a page break. If the margin width of the line
        after the page break is less than the line before the page
        break, then inserts a blank line in the <small>HTML</small>

        The utility only recognizes lines with " <b>-</b> " (the
        normal separator between manpage references and summary
        text) while in keyword search mode. The utility can be
        hooked in a <small>CGI</small> script/program to convert
        manpages on the fly. This is the reason for the option. The
        order that section head mapping is searched is not defined.
        Therefore, if two or more can match a give manpage section,
        there is no way to determine which map tag is chosen. If is
        specified, all xrefs are detected after the heading. In
        other words, sections after may contain hyperlinked xrefs.
        Text that is flush to the left margin, but is not actually
        a section head, can be mistaken for a section head. This
        mistake is more likely when the option is in affect. This
